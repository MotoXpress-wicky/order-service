/**
 * Announces events with an OUTBOX (M46, replaces the "lost if RabbitMQ is down" limit of M19).
 * <p>
 * publish() does not talk to RabbitMQ. It saves the event in the table outbox_events, in the SAME transaction as
 * the change it announces. So the change and its event are saved together or not at all, and an event of a rolled
 * back change never exists.
 * <p>
 * After the commit, OutboxRelay sends the waiting events at once. If RabbitMQ is down, they wait in the table and a
 * scheduled retry sends them later. The request of the user is never broken by RabbitMQ.
 * <p>
 * Without a transaction, publish() saves the row and sends at once.
