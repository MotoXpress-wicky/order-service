/**
 * The thread that sends outbox events after a commit.
 * <p>
 * It is ONE background thread, on purpose. If the request threads did the sending themselves, they would wait for each
 * other (one sender at a time) while still holding their database connections, and the sender needs one more
 * connection for its own transaction. With about as many requests as connections in the pool, nothing could move
 * until the pool timed out. Now a request only signals this thread and returns at once. It also never waits for a
 * RabbitMQ that is down.
 * <p>
 * events.outbox.async=false runs the sending inside the calling thread instead (the tests use this).
